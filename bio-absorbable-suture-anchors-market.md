<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-absorbable Suture Anchors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Knotted</li><li>Knotless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bio-absorbable suture anchors market is divided into two main types: knotted and knotless. Knotted suture anchors utilize traditional knot-tying techniques to secure sutures to the bone, providing a reliable connection. In contrast, knotless suture anchors simplify the procedure by eliminating the need for knots, allowing for a faster and more efficient deployment. Knotless anchors often provide better tissue tensioning and reduce the risk of knot-related complications, making them increasingly popular in orthopedic and surgical applications.</p></p>
